									<h3>senior design - ShopEZ</h3>
									<h4>spring '21</h4>
									<br>
									<h4><strong>motivation</strong></h4>
									<p>
										A quarter of the budget of all store operations is in customer service, with much of that cost coming from the customer service
										spent at the checkout lane. ShopEZ seeks to reinvent the shopping experience by providing customers with a means of performing
										their own self-checkout from their shopping cart.
									</p>
									<p>
										Current means of eliminating the self-checkout line have not been successful. Scanner modules seen at grocery stores
										still need to be brought to the checkout line in order to pay. Amazon Go seeks to solve the problem via a Computer Vision
										based solution; however, customer discovery found that many stores and customers take issues with the underlying privacy issues.
										Amazon has also created a smart-shopping cart to be used at Whole Foods; however, this would require a store to completely
										replace all shopping carts and baskets for a full integration. 
									</p>
									<p>
										ShopEZ seeks to solve all these problems via an easy-to-use and cheap add-on to any shopping cart. It provides both a hardware-based
										solution and a software-based solution in order to accomodate customers who may or may not be comfortable with paying from their phone.
										For further questions, feel free to email me.

									<h3>"Navigating the Latent Space of Generative Models"</h3>
									<h4>fall'19 - fall'20</h4>

									<br>
									<h4><strong>motivation</strong></h4>
									<br>
									<p>
										Over the past 20 years, the field of deep learning has exploded in its modern-day significance. In particular, the topic
										of generative models in deep learning has advanced at an astronomical rate, ever since the inception of the Generative
										Adversarial Network (GAN) in 2014. The project, sponsored by the Fall 2020 President’s Undergraduate Research Award,
										focused on the localization of points in the latent space of generative models. Our research sought to answer whether an
										agent could navigate the latent space of any generative model (Variational Autoencoders and GANs), given n pairs of
										comparison queries.
									</p>
									<p>
										As the latent space of deep learning generative models is condensed into features, rather than the input (i.e., images),
										humans cannot navigate the latent space by means of a direct search. Rather, the human must perform a manual search
										through the latent space of the generative model, searching for any desired features. This task quickly becomes
										infeasible for humans when generalizing to k dimensions, as the latent space of significant generative models (i.e.
										StyleGAN) reach 512 dimensions. This problem is only worsened when dealing with GANs, as the architecture of a “vanilla”
										GAN does not include an encoder, which would allow for a direct translation from image to latent space. This means that
										any latent point serving as the target image needed to be randomly sampled from the latent space of a GAN, which heavily
										limited the ability to quantitatively measure the reconstruction of images from latent points.
									</p>
									<p>
										The most-significant finding from my experimentation with GANs took place with the NVIDIA’s state-of-the-art StyleGAN
										v2. Through the use of random localization, where users are asked to select the more ideal image from a query of
										two-randomly generated images, I was able to achieve the results on the right, localizing a latent point that
										qualitatively is extremely similar to a desired target image! These results are enormously promising, as the 5000
										comparisons were made via a simple mean-square-error metric for images of size 1024x1024 in a 512-dimensional latent
										space. From a quantitative standpoint, the results still showed promise, as the mean-squared-error was reduced from
										1.031 to 0.138. Additionally, the state-of-the-art metric Frebuchet Inception Distance (FID), which measures the
										accuracy of image reconstruction via a classifier trained on the ImageNet dataset, further showcased the viability of
										our localization scheme in the complex GAN latent space. Taking advantage of StyleGAN’s revolutionary projection method,
										which serves as a means of encoding images to the latent space of a GAN, I was able to implement a scheme of measuring
										the FID of our reconstructed images.
